Maximum Searching Algorithm
============================

**An Introduction to Maximum Searching Algorithm**

The algorithm for searching for the maximum value solves the problem of
giving a data set and finding the element with the largest value. On a
classic computer, to complete such a task requires a traversal of the
database, the complexity is :math:`O(N)`. The quantum algorithm for
searching for the maximum value is based on the Grover search algorithm.
It was proposed by Christoph Durr and Peter Hoyer in January 1999 [A
quantum algorithm for finding the minimum]
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9607014). Ashish Ahuja and Sanjiv Kapoor
then made a better complexity analysis and yielded a bound than the
original one of :math:`15\sqrt{N}` [A Quantum Algorithm for finding the
Maximum] (https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9911082v1). The complexity of
the algorithm is :math:`O(\sqrt(N)),` which is quadratic acceleration
compared to the classical algorithm. Below we briefly introduce this
quantum algorithm.

Basic idea of the quantum algorithm for searching the maximum value:
For the search space A (a dataset), select one of the elements as the
current maximum element randomly, and use the improved Grover search
algorithm, that is, the Grover algorithm that does not know the number
of target elements, to search for a larger element in A. Then replace
the maximum element with the new one. The expected value of the total
replacing times to get the maximum element is no more than
:math:`O(log N)`. After finding the maximum element, the Grover
algorithm cannot find a new element. Then the algorithm stops and
outputs the maximum element.

**Improved Grover search algorithm (Grover algorithm without knowing the number of target elements)**

As can be seen from the above description, the improved Grover search
algorithm plays an important role in the algorithm for searching for the
maximum. We use the HiQ demo to implement an improved Grover search
algorithm.
